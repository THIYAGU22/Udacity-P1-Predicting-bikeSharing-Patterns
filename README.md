To build a neural network from scratch to carry out a prediction problem on a real dataset! 

# Project Overview :
to build a neural network from scratch to carry out a prediction problem on a real dataset! 
By building a neural network from the ground up, you'll have a much better understanding of 
* gradient descent
* backpropagation
* feedforward
* and other concepts
that are important to know before we move to higher level tools such as PyTorch. 
The data comes from the UCI Machine Learning Database.
